# Draw L-System

I've achieved both drawing and animating the drawing process with three methods.

1. Python generates words and draws with Turtle library.
2. Python generates coordinates and draws with Blender.
3. Python generates coordinates and draws with Unity. (C#)

For each of the above methods, please check the subdirectories to find more details about this.
